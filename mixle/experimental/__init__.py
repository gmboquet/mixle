"""``mixle.experimental`` -- exploratory surfaces that are not (yet) part of mixle's mature API.

Code here is kept for exploration and may change or be removed without the usual stability guarantees.

Current contents:

- :mod:`mixle.experimental.program` -- the optimization-*program* approach (moves + combinators: ``minimize`` /
  ``maximize`` / ``em`` / ``alternate`` / ``weighted`` / ``constrain`` / ``reinforce`` / ``pareto`` / ``bilevel``
  / ``gail`` / ``maxent_irl``) to fitting heterogeneous neural + stats models. A reasonable idea that wasn't
  mature: its closure-taking surface (``minimize(lambda: loss, over=params)``) is exactly the PyTorch-style jank
  it set out to avoid. For the common cases it is **superseded by the declarative neural surface** --
  ``Categorical(logits=Net(...)).fit(y, given=...)``, ``Normal(Net(...), free).fit(...)``, and mixtures of
  ``SoftmaxNeuralLeaf`` experts -- which compose into the PPL with no loss closures. It is kept here for the
  genuinely game-shaped cases the declarative surface does not reach (GANs, on-policy RL).
